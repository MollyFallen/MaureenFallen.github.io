						This was a project done for HCDE 310. It creates a playlist based off of a Pokemon team by matching the Pokemon type retrieved from the PokeAPI with a genre from Spotify playlist.

						My Contributions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I handled the Pokemon API. I retrieved the information for all of the Pokemon and used python to extract each Pokemon's type then matched it with a genre and returned the infromation to be used with the Spotify API.
						</li>
						<li>
							I created all of the HTML/CSS for the page.
						</li>
						<li>
							I did all of the visual design, picking fonts, backgrounds and layouts.
						</li>

						Our team won Best Hack by creating a "flux capacitor" that can detect lightning strikes in the area, up to 40 km away. This could eventually be used by people in high risk areas to know when to seek shelter.

						My Contributions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I used Fusion 360 to design and 3D print a smaller and more compact case for the prototype that could eventually be used in the workplace. 
						</li>
						<li>
							I decided on the visual design for the actual detector. We used the flux capacitor model already created by Eric and I painted it to resemble the flux capacitor in the movie.  
						</li>
						<li>
							I made design decisions for the app that could be paired with the device for a faster alert time.
