					Repurpose

					This was a project started at ProtoHack in March 2015. Since then it has grown into a startup that's on its way to 
					revolutionizing the way schools acquire goods. We aim to connect businesses with excess goods to schools in need. I met the 
					team at ProtoHack and this mockup is based off of the original wireframes I made in March. Darren, who originally had the idea, 
					envisioned a website that functioned similarly to Craigslist, so I made a site to reflect that. Since then, we've moved in 
					a different direction and we are going into our first phase of testing with the users.

					</li>
					<li>
