					Here, I tested my interactions in inVision and realized that I hadn't been accounting for the small size
					of the smartwatch as much as I should have. I simplified the text into icons. I also
					increased the thickness of some of the borders to make them more visible.

					Digital Pet for a Smartwatch
				</p>
				<p>	
					This is a personal project based on the idea of creating a digital pet designed for smartwatches. Smartwatches are often passive and it was fun to create something active. The pet will be able to be fed and played with. Playing with the pet restores hearts and gives credits to buy more food or games.
